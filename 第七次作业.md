###Abstract
######In 1845,American Alexander Joy Cartwright first formulate a set of rules for Baseball. the baseball has been considered as a most popular sport in America and Japan. ![此处输入图片的描述][1] The problem we focus on here, is that due to the uneven surface of the baseball, different air drag act on the different location of the surface. Then the trajectory of the baseball when the thrower throw it will be very complex especially when the thrower use a bit of skill to add some spin on the baseball,such as the curve ball and the knuckball. We will build a simple model to find the trajectory of the baseball in different situations numerically.
###fundamental principle
######the most simple model is just the ideal situation without the air drag and spin:![此处输入图片的描述][2]
######the new feature differ with the previous model is that now the dimension of motion is three. 
######this model is so trival, we will say that since there are many stitches on the baseball even when the speed of baseball is very small, the effect of the drag force is quite obivous. To attach to the real situation in the baseball match, we must add the air drag in it. As the experimental measurement, we get a empircial formula:![此处输入图片的描述][3], (the Vd is the speed of the wind,V is the speed of the baseball, we can say the bigger the speed,the smaller the drag cofficient. the following wind will enlarge the cofficient the againist wind will decrease the cofficient.the Delta=5m/s .now adding the air drag force, we can see the model is ![此处输入图片的描述][4]
######Now we consider the most important factor spin in the motion of the baseball. Since the existence of the spin,can the baseball be played so diverisfied. When the spin is considered, the new force :the magnus force appears,in the previous situation we only consider the baseball as a whole body, however, when there is spin on the baseball, due to on the different location of the baseball, there is different speed, different speed will contribute to different magnus force then just after we add up all the force, it must exist a nonzero net force( unlike the previous air drag, the magnus force is vertial to the direction of the speed).
######we consider two situation with different orientation of the spin. because when the baseball has spin in the y-direction. The air drag on the top of the baseball is proportional to the ![此处输入图片的描述][5] while on the bottom of the baseball the force is proportional to the ![此处输入图片的描述][6],then the magnus force is proportional to the ![此处输入图片的描述][7], we set the magnus force to be ![此处输入图片的描述][8]  and the cofficient S0/m=0.00041. And then the model is ![此处输入图片的描述][9] this is the basic priciple of the curve ball.
######Then it's time for the knuckball, the thrower make the ball rotate slowly enough, the trajectory of the baseball will vary sharply. To understand the mechanism, the Watts and Sawyer measure the air drag force accurately, they find a equation to describe the behavior of the air drag force. ![此处输入图片的描述][10].the angle varied by time. ![此处输入图片的描述][11]the initial angle is relevant to the initial orientation of the stitches.
###the numerical result and program.
######only with drag force:![此处输入图片的描述][12]
######the initial speed is 50m/s and the initial angle is 35
